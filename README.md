# Svelte Workshop Demo
This is the polished up version of the final product from the Svelte Workshop I gave for UCT's Google Developer Student Club on 18/05/2023. The workshop was a brief introduction to Svelte, aimed at people who have some experience with front-end development, but have never used Svelte before.

The workshop was in no way comprehensive, and further reading can be done at [svelte.dev/tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial).
